# Security Policy
The security policy for Irreverent Labs is based off of Solana's security policy, which can be found [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Reporting Security Issues to Irreverent Labs
**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead please send an email to [biz@irreverentlabs.com](mailto:biz@irreverentlabs.com) and provide your Github username so that we can add you to a new draft security advisory for further discussion.

For security reasons, DO NOT include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the security issue in this email. Instead, wait for the advisory to be created, and **provide any sensitive details in the private GitHub advisory**.

## Security Bug Bounties
We may pay a bug bounty at our discretion after verifying the bug. This bounty is only paid out if details about the security issues have not been provided to any third parties before a fix has been introduced and verified.

Furthermore, the reporter is in no way allowed to exploit the issue without our explicit consent.
